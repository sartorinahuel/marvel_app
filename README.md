# marvel_app

a test for Carrots Lab

## Getting Started

The app is separated into three folders: Data, Domain and Ui. 
Domain contains the contracts to be followed by the implementations, the classes and the service contracts.
The Data folder contains the implementations of these contracts and in the UI it has all the screens and widgets.
